<p id="simple para"><span class="mouse">LO! Death</span>
 hath rear'd himself a throne</img id="throne" src="img/Sun"/>
In a strange city, all alone,
<a href="http://google.com"target="_blank">Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
</a>Have gone to their <span id="eternal">eternal</span> rest.
</p>

<p id="blinking para">There shrines, and palaces, and <span class="o">o</span>wers
Are — n<span id="o">o</span>t like any thing of <span id="o">o</span>urs —
<span class="o">O</span>h n<span class="o">o</span>!— <span class="o">O</span>n

T<span class="o">o</span>heaven with that ung <span class="o">o</span>dly gl<span class="o">oo</span>m!
Time-eaten t<span class="o">o</span>wers that tremble n<span class="o">o</span>t!
Resemble n<span class="o">o</span> thing that is <span id="o">o</span>urs.
Ar<span class="o">o</span>und, by lifting winds f<span id="o">o</span>rg
<span id="o">o</span>t,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melanch<span class="o">o</span>ly waters lie.
</p>

<p id="img-para">
  <span class="top">No holy rays from heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town,
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently —
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask — the viol — and the vine.</span>

</p>
<p>There open temples — open graves</p>
<p id="sliding-paragraph">
  <span class="slide-out">
    Are on a level with the waves —
    But not the riches there that lie
    In each idol's diamond eye,
    Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
  </span>
  <span class="slide-in">
    Tempt the waters from their bed:
    For no ripples curl, alas!
    Along that wilderness of glass —
    No swellings hint that winds may be
  </span>
</p>


<br>
<p id="shape-paragraph">
<span class="top">Upon a far-off happier sea:
So blend the turrets and shadows there
<span id="square"></span>
</p>
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="square2"></div>
<p id="tip-para">But lo! a stir is in the air!
\The wave — there is a ripple there!
As if the towers had thrown aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
As if the turret-tops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven.
</p>
<p id="three-dimensional">
<span class="top">The waves have now a redder glow —
The very hours are breathing low —
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence,
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time.
