  <p><div id="Start-Text"><h2>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne</h2></div>
  In a strange city, all alone,
  Far down within the dim west —
  Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
  <h3><div id="Eternal">Have gone to their eternal rest.</div></h3>
  </p>

  <p>There shrines, and palaces, and towers
  Are — not like any thing of ours —
  <em>Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom
  To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
  Time-eaten towers that tremble not!</em>
  Resemble nothing that is ours.
  Around, by lifting winds forgot,
  Resignedly beneath the sky
  The melancholy waters lie.
  </p>

  <p>No holy rays from heaven come down
  On the long night-time of that town,
  <div id="Mid-Text">But light from out the lurid sea
  Streams up the turrets silently —
  Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
  Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
  Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
  Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —</div>
  Up many a melancholy shrine
  Whose entablatures intertwine
  The mask — the viol — and the vine.
  </p>

  <p>There open temples — open graves
  Are on a level with the waves —
  But not the riches there that lie
  In each idol's diamond eye,
  Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
  Tempt the waters from their bed:
  For no ripples curl, alas!
  Along that wilderness of glass —
  No swellings hint that winds may be
  Upon a far-off happier sea:
  So blend the turrets and shadows there
  That all seem pendulous in air,
  While from the high towers of the town
  Death looks gigantically down.
  </p>

  <p>But lo! a stir is in the air!
  The wave — there is a ripple there!
  As if the towers had thrown aside,
  In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
  As if the turret-tops had given
  A vacuum in the filmy heaven.
  The waves have now a redder glow —
  The very hours are breathing low —
  And when, amid no earthly moans,
  Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
  All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
  Shall do it reverence,
  And <button>Death to some more happy clime
  Shall give his undivided time.</button>
  </p>
