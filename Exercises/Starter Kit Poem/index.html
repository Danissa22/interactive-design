    <p>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne
    In a strange city, all alone,
    Far down within the dim west —
    Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
    Have gone to their eternal rest.<a href="#anchor">anchor</a></p>
    <span>There shrines, and palaces, and towersAre — not like any thing of ours —
    Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom<strong>To heaven with that ungodly gloom!</strong>.</span> <span>This is another span.</span>
    <h1 class="large">Time-eaten towers that tremble not!
    Resemble nothing that is ours. <em>Around, by lifting winds forgot,</em>
    Resignedly beneath the sky
    The melancholy waters lie.</h1>
    <h2 class="centered">No holy rays from heaven come down
    On the long night-time of that town,</h2>
    <h3 class="regular">But light from out the lurid sea
    Streams up the turrets silently —
    Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
    Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
    Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —</h3>
    <h4>Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —</h4>
    <h5>Up many a melancholy shrine</h5>
    <h6>Whose entablatures intertwine</h6>

      <h6>The mask — the viol — and the vine.</h6>
    <hr>
      <h6>There open temples — open graves
      Are on a level with the waves —</h6>
    <hr>
      <h6>But not the riches there that lie
      In each idol's diamond eye,
</h6>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>ot the gaily-jewell'd dead
      Tempt the waters from their bed:
      For no ripples curl, alas!</li>
      <li>Along that wilderness of glass —
      No swellings hint that winds may be
      Upon a far-off happier sea:</li>
      <li id="letterspace">So blend the turrets and shadows there
      That all seem pendulous in air,</li>
      <li>This is a list of Death</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="anchor">While from the high towers of the town</p>
    <p id="rotate">Death looks gigantically down.</p>
    <div class="float1"><p> But lo! a stir is in the air!</p></div>
    <div class="float2"><p>The wave — there is a ripple there!
    As if the towers had thrown aside,
</p></div>
    <p id="capitalize">In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
    As if the turret-tops had given
    A vacuum in the filmy heaven.</p>
    <p id="lineheight">
      The waves have now a redder glow —<br>
        The very hours are breathing low —<br>
        And when, amid no earthly moans,<br>
        Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
        All Hades, from a thousand thrones,<br>
      </p>
