	<p id="one">LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne <br>
	In a strange city, all alone,
	Far down within the dim west —<br>
	Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
	Have gone to their eternal rest.<br>
	</p>

	<p id="two">There shrines, and palaces, and towers
	Are — not like any thing of ours —<br>
	Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom<br>
	To heaven with that ungodly gloom!</p>

	<p id="three">Time-eaten towers that tremble not! <br>
	Resemble nothing that is ours.</p>

	<p id="four">Around, by lifting winds forgot,
	Resignedly beneath the sky
	The melancholy waters lie.
	</p>

	<p id="five">No holy rays from heaven come down<br>
	On the long night-time of that town,</p>
	<p id="six">But light from out the lurid sea
	Streams up the turrets silently — <br>
	Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
	Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
	Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
	Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —<br>
	Up many a melancholy shrine<br>
	Whose entablatures intertwine
	The mask — the viol — and the vine.
	</p>

	<p id="six">There open temples — open graves
	Are on a level with the waves —<br>
	But not the riches there that lie
	In each idol's diamond eye,
	Not the gaily-jewell'd dead </p>
	<p id="seven">
	Tempt the waters from their bed:<br>
	For no ripples curl, alas!<br>
	Along that wilderness of glass —
	No swellings hint that winds may be
	Upon a far-off happier sea:<br>
	So blend the turrets and shadows there
	</p>
	<p id="eight"> That all seem pendulous in air, &nsbp;
	While from the high towers of the town
	Death looks gigantically down.
	</p>

	<p id="nine">But lo! a stir is in the air!<br>
	The wave — there is a ripple there!
	As if the towers had thrown aside,
	In slightly sinking, the dull tide —<br>
	As if the turret-tops had given
	A vacuum in the filmy heaven.<br>
</p>
	<p id="ten">The waves have now a redder glow —
	The very hours are breathing low — <br>
	And when, amid no earthly moans,
	Down, down, that town shall settle hence,<br></p>
	<p id="elven">All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
	Shall do it reverence,<br>
	And Death to some more happy clime
	Shall give his undivided time.
	</p>
