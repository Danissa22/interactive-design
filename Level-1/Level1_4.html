<p>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne
In a strange city, all alone,
Far down within the dim west — <br>
Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
Have gone to their eternal rest.
</p>

<p>There shrines, and palaces, and towers
Are — not like any thing of ours —<br>
Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom <br>
To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
Time-eaten towers that tremble not!
<br>
</p>
	<p> <br>Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
</p>

<p>No holy rays from heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town,
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently —<br>
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —<br>
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask —he viol — and the vine.
</p>
<br>

<p>There open temples — open graves
Are on a level with the waves —
But not the riches there that lie<br>
In each idol's diamond eye,
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
Tempt the waters from their bed: <br>
For no ripples curl, alas! &nsbp; </p>

<p>
Along that wilderness of glass —
No swellings hint that winds may be <br>
Upon a far-off happier sea:
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down.
</p>

<p>But lo! a stir is in the air!
The wave — there is a ripple there!
<br>
As if the towers had thrown aside,&nsbp;
In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
As if the turret-tops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven.
</p>
<p>
The waves have now a redder glow —
The very hours are breathing low —<br>
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence,<br>
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time.
</p>
