<p>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne <br>
In a strange city, all alone, 
Far down within the dim west —<br>
Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
Have gone to their eternal rest.<br>
</p>

<p>There shrines, and palaces, and towers
Are — not like any thing of ours —<br>
Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom<br>
To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
Time-eaten towers that tremble not! <br>
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot, 
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
</p>

<p>No holy rays from heaven come down<br>
On the long night-time of that town, 
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently — <br>
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —<br>
Up many a melancholy shrine<br>
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask — the viol — and the vine.
</p>

<p>There open temples — open graves
Are on a level with the waves —<br>
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye,
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead </p>
<p>
Tempt the waters from their bed:<br>
For no ripples curl, alas!<br>
Along that wilderness of glass —
No swellings hint that winds may be
Upon a far-off happier sea:<br>
So blend the turrets and shadows there
</p>
<p> That all seem pendulous in air, &nsbp;
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down.
</p>

<p>But lo! a stir is in the air!<br>
The wave — there is a ripple there!
As if the towers had thrown aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide —<br>
As if the turret-tops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven.<br>
The waves have now a redder glow —
The very hours are breathing low — <br>
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down, that town shall settle hence,<br>
All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence,<br>
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time.
</p>
