<p><strong>LO!<strong> <h3>Death</h3> hath rear'd himself a throne
In a strange city, all alone,
Far down within the dim west —
<h3>Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,</h3>
Have gone to their eternal rest.
</p>

<p><h3>There shrines, and palaces, and towers</h3>
Are — not like any thing of ours —
Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom
<div><h4>To heaven with that ungodly gloom!</h4></div>
Time-eaten towers that tremble not!
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
</p>

<p><h3>No <em>holy rays</em> from heaven come down</h3>
On the long night-time of that town,
<div>But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently —
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers </div>
<strong>Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —</strong>
<h4>Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —<h4>
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask — the viol — and the vine.
</p>

<p>There open temples — open graves
Are on a level with the waves —
<div>But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye,
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
Tempt the waters from their bed:
For no ripples curl, alas!</div>
<em>Along that wilderness of glass —</em>
No swellings hint that winds may be
<h4>Upon a far-off happier sea:<h4>
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from the high towers of the town
<h3>Death looks gigantically down.</h3>
</p>

<p><h3>But lo! a stir is in the air!</h3>
The wave — there is a ripple there!
As if the towers had thrown aside,<div>In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
As if the turret-tops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven.</div>
<strong>The waves have now a redder glow —</strong>
<div>The very hours are breathing low —
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down, that town shall settle hence,</div>
<h4>All Hades, from a thousand thrones,</h4>
Shall do it reverence,
And <strong>Death<strong> to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time.
</p>
