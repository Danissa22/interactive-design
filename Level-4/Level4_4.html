<p>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne
In a strange city, all alone,
Far down within the dim west —
Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
<h4>Have gone to their eternal rest.</h4>
</p>

<p>There shrines, and palaces, and towers
<em>Are — not like any thing of ours —
Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom
To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
Time-eaten towers that tremble not!</em>
<h4>Resemble nothing that is ours.</h4>
<strong>Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.</strong>
</p>

<p><em>o holy rays from heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town,
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently —
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine</em>
<h4>The mask — the viol — and the vine.</h4>
</p>

<p><em>There open temples — open graves
Are on a level with the waves —
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye,
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
Tempt the waters from their bed:
For no ripples curl, alas!</em>T
<strong>Along that wilderness of glass —
No swellings hint that winds may be</strong>
<em>Upon a far-off happier sea:
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from the high towers of the town</em>
<h4>Death looks gigantically down.
</h4>
</p>

<p><em>But lo! a stir is in the air!
The wave — there is a ripple there!
As if the towers had thrown aside,</em>
<strong>In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
As if the turret-tops had given</strong>
<h4>A vacuum in the filmy heaven.</h4>
The waves have now a redder glow —
The very hours are breathing low —
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
<h5>All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence,
And Death to some more happy clime
Shall give his undivided time.</h5>
</p>
