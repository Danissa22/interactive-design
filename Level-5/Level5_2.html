    <p><div><h3>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne
In a strange city, all alone,
Far down within the dim west —</h3></div>
<div id= "where">Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,</div>
Have gone to their eternal rest.
</p>

<p>There shrines, and palaces, and towers
    <ul><li>Are — not like any thing of ours —</li>
    <li>Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom</li>
    <li>To heaven with that ungodly gloom!</li>
    <li>Time-eaten towers that tremble not!</li>
    <li>Resemble nothing that is ours.</li>
    <li>Around, by lifting winds forgot,</li>
    <li>Resignedly beneath the sky</li></ul>
The melancholy waters lie.
</p>

<p><div id="Light">No holy rays from heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town,</div>
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently —
<ul><li>Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers</li>
<li>Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —</li>
<li>Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —</li>
    <li>Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —</li>
    <li>Up many a melancholy shrine</li>
    <li>Whose entablatures intertwine</li> </ul>
The mask — the viol — and the vine.
</p>

<p>There open temples — open graves
    <ul><li>Are on a level with the waves —</li>
    <li>But not the riches there that lie</li>
    <li>In each idol's diamond eye,</li>
    <li>Not the gaily-jewell'd dead</li>
</ul>
Tempt the waters from their bed:
For no ripples curl, alas!
<ul>
   <li>Along that wilderness of glass —</li>
    <li>No swellings hint that winds may be</li>
</ul>
<div>Upon a far-off happier sea:
So blend the turrets and shadows there
</div>
<div>That all seem pendulous in air,
While from the high towers of the town
Death looks gigantically down.</div>
</p>

<p>But lo! a stir is in the air!
    <ul><li>The wave — there is a ripple there!</li>
    <li>As if the towers had thrown aside,</li>
    <li>In slightly sinking, the dull tide —</li>
    <li>As if the turret-tops had given</li></ul>
A vacuum in the filmy heaven.
    <ul><li>The waves have now a redder glow —</li>
    <li>The very hours are breathing low —</li>
    <li>And when, amid no earthly moans,</li>
    <li>Down, down, that town shall settle hence,</li></ul>

<div>Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
All Hades, from a thousand thrones,</div>
Shall do it reverence,
<div>And Death to some more happy clime</div>
<button>Shall give his undivided time.</button>
</p>
