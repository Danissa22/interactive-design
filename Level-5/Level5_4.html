<p><h1>LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne</h1>
In a strange city, all alone,
    <div>Far down within the dim west —</div>

<strong>Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,</strong>
<h3>Have gone to their eternal rest.</h3>

<p>There shrines, and palaces, and towers
<div>Are — not like any thing of ours —
<strong>Oh no! — O no! — </strong>ours never loom
To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
Time-eaten towers that tremble not!
Resemble nothing that is ours.</div>
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
</p>

<p>No holy rays from heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town,
But light from out the lurid sea
<div><strong>Streams up the turrets silently —
Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —
Up many a melancholy shrine
Whose entablatures intertwine
The mask — the viol — and the vine.</strong></div>
</p>

<p>There open temples — open graves
Are on a level with the waves —
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye,
Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
Tempt the waters from their bed:
<em>For no ripples curl, alas!</em>
<div>long that wilderness of glass —
No swellings hint that winds may be
Upon a far-off happier sea:
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from the high towers of the town</div>
<h1>Death looks gigantically down.</h1>
</p>

<p><strong>But lo! a stir is in the air!</strong>
The wave — there is a ripple there!
As if the towers had thrown aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
As if the turret-tops had given
A vacuum in the filmy heaven.
<div>The waves have now a redder glow —
The very hours are breathing low —
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down, that town shall settle hence,</div>
<h3>All Hades, from a thousand thrones,</h3>
<em>Shall do it reverence,</em>
<h1>And Death to some more happy clime</h1>
Shall give his undivided time.
</p>
